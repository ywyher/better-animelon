# What is it ?
An [Animleon](https://www.animelon.com/) alternative that aims to overcome all animelon's inconvenients

# Why ?
Animelon doesn’t provide all anime by default, and its entries are rarely updated, making it difficult for learners who want to watch modern anime with subtitles. That’s why I decided to create this website—to offer the latest anime with subtitles, along with real-time Japanese subtitle translation, providing a more feature-rich alternative.

# Roadmap
> [!note]
> This project is still in its early stages so a lot of crucial stuff are yet to be implemented for this project to be called a usable alternative
- [x] Search system
- [x] Filtering system 
- [ ] Implementing watching anime feature
