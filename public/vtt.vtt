00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.260
<i>On March 1st, 18 years ago,</i>

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.180
<i>Hinazuki was standing alone at this park as always.</i>

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.180
<i>It was a little before 6 p.m.</i>

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.220
<i>I headed for the hideout back then.</i>

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.340
<i>I think I went to get my gloves.</i>

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.010
<i>I don't remember whether
I actually found them there.</i>

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.350
<i>When I left the hideout and glanced
towards the river bank,</i>

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.750
<i>I saw Yuuki-san sitting there, facing the water.</i>

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.360
<i>And by the time I took the shortest
route back and passed by the park,</i>

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.170
<i>Hinazuki was gone.</i>

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.570
Look at the blackboard, class.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.530
<i>A week from now, Hinazuki Kayo will become the
first victim in a serial kidnapping and murder case.</i>

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.270
<i>On X-Day.</i>

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.770
<i>If I can make sure nothing
happens on March 1st,</i>

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.290
<i>and have a birthday party
with Hinazuki the next day,</i>

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.260
<i>that will definitely mean
I've changed the future.</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.930
<i>I'll erase those crimes from the history books.</i>

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.980
Another tomorrow became today as I waited for you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.230
I stopped and looked back at the never-ending days with a sigh

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.490
Finally I realized my memories would fade into nothing

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.540
And a small part of my heart has been grieving since

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
I can't let it slip away again

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.670
Or I'll never be able to tell you on that day

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.130
That I regret everything that's happened around me since

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.260
Another tomorrow became today as I waited for you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.310
Each day tears another hole in me

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.030
It has to be you...

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.670
Morning, Satoru.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.710
Morning.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.420
Breakfast will be done in a bit.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.850
'Kay.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.810
Thanks for the food.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.270
Hey, Mom.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.710
I want to go out on Saturday.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.720
On a date?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.640
N-No! I thought I might visit the science center with my friends.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.180
Aw, I'd've given you some extra
pocket money if it was a date.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.910
<i>For real?</i>

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.120
It's actually a date, ain't it?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.690
Yep.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.090
You should invite her here.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.710
We could have some hot pot or something.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.130
Hinazuki is coming to the birthday party.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.260
Oh, you mean the Hinazukis over on 5th?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.430
<i>Damn, I'm giving her all the answers she wants.</i>

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640
Just be careful when you go.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.550
Thanks.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.430
Now hurry up and eat.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.000
'Kay!

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.900
Rise. Bow.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.520
Goodbye!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.630
Doesn't the next Liveman look amazing?!

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.670
It does!

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.970
What's a "falcon"?

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.070
They're like eagles!

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.450
Wow, you're so smart.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.370
<i>This Saturday, I'm going to get
Hinazuki out of her house.</i>

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.030
<i>Or rather, away from her mother's abuse.</i>

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.680
Sensei!

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.590
Sen—sei!

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.510
What is it?

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.710
I don't get this part. Could you explain it?

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.380
Let me see.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.370
Ugh, they're so flirty with him.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.540
Didn't you use to be just like them until recently?

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.310
Quit being stubborn and join them, yo.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.650
"Yo"? Are you tryin' to act cool?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.330
<i>Crap.</i>

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.760
Sensei thinks I'm a thief.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.400
And so do you.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.030
Forget it.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.040
Guys, I've got an idea.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.760
What is it?

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.360
Well, why don't we visit the
 science center on Saturday?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.020
Hinazuki's coming too.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.500
Sounds goo—

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.020
Sorry, Satoru.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.930
There's something I gotta do that day.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.870
O-Oh...

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.530
I can't go either, Satoru. I've got
something important to do too.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.130
Y-Yeah. I'd love to go, but I'm busy as well.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.000
S-Same here.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.730
I see...

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.840
If you're going with Hinazuki,
you'd be better off without us.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840
Laters!

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.280
Something happen, Fujinuma?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.400
Oh, nothing.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.140
<i>"I told them I can't hang out on Saturday
'cause I've got a date with you."</i>

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.140
I told them I can't hang out on Saturday
'cause I've got a date with you.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.330
<i>Should I say that?</i>

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.310
<i>I </i>did<i> say that.</i>

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.580
But...

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.540
my mother told me to come straight home on Saturdays.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.570
I want to take you somewhere.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.010
I'll talk to her for you.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.280
Kenya.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.460
Could you drop by the staff room for a bit?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.350
Absolutely not. I'm not going to allow
two kids to go out on their own.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.070
We're not just going to play.
We'll get to learn things!

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.230
You can do that at home.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.240
Saturday's the day Kayo helps me at home.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.280
Helps you? With what?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.700
<i>Releasing your pent-up stress?</i>

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.450
I don't see the need to answer that.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.840
Why are you so against her going out?

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.270
I can think of several reasons!

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.190
You're kids.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.540
Who do you think will have to 
take responsibility if something happens?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.030
<i>This bitch has some nerve.</i>

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.260
What's wrong with you?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.260
What do you get out of taking this gloomy girl out?

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.100
Who cares about that? I just want to save my friend!

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.420
Save?

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.860
Save Kayo from what?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.440
You think you're some knight in shining armor?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.920
<i>Shit!</i>

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.900
<i>I really shouldn't have hinted at her abuse!</i>

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.660
How do you feel, Kayo?

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.150
You want to go with him?

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.740
Get your minds out of the gutter,
you perverted kids!

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.750
Mom!

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.100
Stop it, Hinazuki-san.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.460
You shouldn't go around calling kids perverted.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.340
Fujinuma-san...

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.320
This is none of your business.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.000
Half of it is.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.340
Our kids are motivated about something,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.470
so as their parents, shouldn't we help them out?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.410
I think our families are pretty similar.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.900
Drop by for a chat sometime.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.800
Get inside, Kayo.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.070
Okay.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.870
S-See you on Saturday. It's a promise.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.530
I didn't intrude, did I?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.210
Nah. Thank you.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.570
I got off work early and 
just happened to see you kids.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.170
Good thing I followed you.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.300
You were following us?!

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.470
I-I was obviously kidding.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.380
Anyway, things should be okay for today.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.950
That girl was wearing surprisingly nice clothes.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.440
It shows that her mother is 
conscious about appearances.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.160
Do you know what's going on over there?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.200
Nah.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.900
But after our conversation and looking at her mother, I can make a guess.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.940
<i>That's a former TV news reporter for you.</i>

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.830
Kayo's pretty cute, huh?

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.120
<i>You're 29 years old! What are you blushing for?!</i>

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.950
You'd better not give up just yet.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.710
Of course.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.820
<i>Saturday, February 27th.</i>

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.130
<i>It's a clear day.</i>

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.510
<i>Looks like Hinazuki's mother has thought
twice about hitting her these past few days.</i>

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.210
This guy's my friend.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.850
Are you stupid?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.810
Man, I love this place!

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.530
There's hardly anyone around.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.480
It's like we snuck in. Exciting, right?

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.280
I hide whenever I see anybody.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.780
<i>Hey, she didn't ask me if I was stupid.</i>

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.000
Take a peek into this thing.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.530
Wanna see the planetarium? It's just about to start.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.580
I got my fill of stars the other night.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.920
I guess...

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.880
I need to run to the bathroom.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.720
Okay. I'll be around.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.640
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.700
<i>Déjà vu?</i>

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.330
<i>I did come here often,</i>

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.920
<i>but never with Hinazuki.</i>

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.800
Hinazuki...

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.840
Fujinuma.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.120
Thanks for inviting me today.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.850
Did you know I liked this place too?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.700
<i>Did I know?</i>

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.550
<i>Is that why I chose this place?</i>

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.520
<i>Do aspiring comic artists...</i>

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.520
Do aspiring comic artists...

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.190
<i>tend to come to places like this?</i>

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.190
tend to come to places like this?

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.560
<i>I remember having the same
conversation 18 years ago.</i>

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.980
<i>I came here by myself and ran into Hinazuki.</i>

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.900
What is it?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.970
N-Nothing. You think there's a connection?

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.800
<i>Am I just repeating the past?</i>

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.650
<i>I've been trying to change the future.</i>

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.060
<i>Have I been unwittingly following the same path?</i>

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.900
Hinazuki!

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.550
I'll hold your coat for you.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.280
You sure?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.780
<i>I've already changed a bunch
of things with my actions.</i>

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.810
<i>I know that I can change the future.</i>

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.830
Fujinuma.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.790
I'm glad I mustered up the courage to come.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.040
Me too.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.120
Satoru.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.170
Hinazuki.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.310
Hey there!

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.570
I got done early, so I came.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.800
Sorry we're late.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.770
<i>See? It changed.</i>

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.710
Are we interrupting?

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.240
Of course not.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.460
Right, Hinazuki?

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.200
Right.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.140
Wow, Satoru's such a gentleman!

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.890
Good morning!

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.470
Morning, Fujinuma.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.830
Oh, morning, Hinazuki.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.230
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.710
<i>It's Monday, but she's here on time.</i>

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.590
<i>Such a pretty face...</i>

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.590
Such a pretty face...

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.380
<i>I said that out loud.</i>

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.110
D-Did you hear that?!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.720
February 29th

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.940
Whoa!

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.130
Satoru's got guts!

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.120
Are you gonna get married?!

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.450
Don't be stupid! They gotta get engaged first!

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.220
Get what?

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.220
Congrats!

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.100
We're starting morning homeroom.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.980
<i>Hinazuki will be murdered tomorrow...</i>

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.650
<i>on March 1st.</i>

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.690
<i>The real battle starts now.</i>

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.920
Laters, Hiromi!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.250
See you tomorrow!

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.720
Hey, Hinazuki.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.360
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.690
Let's walk to school together.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.040
Sure.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.580
Oh, Mom...

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.460
Good evening.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.130
See you tomorrow, then. 
I'll come pick you up in the morning.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.620
I'm off!

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.890
Okay!

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.690
<i>I left home a bit early.</i>

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.190
<i>March 1st, 1988.</i>

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.150
<i>The day Hinazuki disappeared 18 years ago.</i>

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.120
Good morning.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.280
<i>But today will be different.</i>

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.210
Morning, Fujinuma.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.460
Morning.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.260
<i>Hinazuki won't be going anywhere.</i>

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.360
We're off.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.290
<i>The circumstances now are 
quite different from 18 years ago.</i>

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.520
Satoru's got guts!

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.740
<i>Hinazuki was targeted because she 
was always by herself at that park.</i>

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.060
Well, you guys better come tomorrow!

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.540
Yeah.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.310
Of course.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.570
<i>That's no longer the case as of a few days ago.</i>

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.760
Hey, let's go to the kids' center.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.170
<i>And I'm with her today.</i>

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.300
I want to go home early today.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.640
Come on, hang out with me.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.320
Okay.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.260
<i>Everything will be all right.</i>

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.550
I win again.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.790
You're good!

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.390
<i>Okay, maybe not everything.</i>

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.830
Hey, Fujinuma. I want to go home now.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.200
Sure, I guess.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.910
It's snowing.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.340
I'll come pick you up tomorrow, too!

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.770
See you tomorrow!

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.920
'Kay.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.810
<i>I said it as loud as I could.</i>

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.530
<i>So that Hinazuki, her mother inside,</i>

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.440
<i>and anybody who might've been
listening nearby got the message.</i>

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.680
<i>That I'm right here.</i>

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.780
<i>X-Day is almost over.</i>

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.200
<i>Is this really it?</i>

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.850
<i>I'm such an idiot.</i>

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.190
<i>Why the hell did I come here?</i>

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.400
<i>I did it!</i>

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.750
<i>I definitely changed history today.</i>

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.490
Morning, Mom.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.980
Huh? It's not even 6 a.m. yet!

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.070
I'm off.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.280
What about breakfast?

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.290
<i>I didn't sleep a wink after that.</i>

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.610
<i>I just wanted to see Hinazuki as soon as possible.</i>

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.400
Morning, Hinazuki.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.830
Are you stupid?

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.020
You guys are free now, right?

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.250
You know it!

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.170
We're gonna party at your place.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.530
Then let's go shopp—

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.120
Hey, Satoru and Kayo.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.290
I need you to help me with something.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.080
Why today of all days?

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.660
Oh, well.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.990
It's probably cause we messed up
while on duty the other day.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.820
Probably.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.800
Man, this is heavy.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.580
Did they seriously not wait for us?

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.760
That's ice cold.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.150
That'll be 5,000 yen.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.720
Got it.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.710
<i>Come to think of it, the bill was 
exactly 5,000 yen 18 years ago too.</i>

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.020
<i>I was so excited about my birthday
that I used up every penny I had.</i>

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.180
<i>I think my mother and I made a ton 
of sandwiches and ate them by ourselves.</i>

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.620
I'm home.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840
One, two...

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.580
Satoru! Hinazuki!

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.300
Happy birthday!

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.320
Y-You planned all this in secret?

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.190
They said they wanted to do this,
so I gave 'em a hand.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.770
Don't tell me...

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.890
Is that why we had to help after school?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.020
Yeah, we asked Yashiro-sensei.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.320
He told us it was Hinazuki's birthday too.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.190
Well, we just wanted to surprise you a bit.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.070
It worked!

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:17.740
Oh, the cakes? Satoru insisted we get two.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.150
Sorry, Fujinuma.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.140
I couldn't finish your present in time.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.630
You were working on something?

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.560
Yeah...

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.720
<i>Oh, so that's why she wanted
to leave so badly yesterday.</i>

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.510
I almost had it done last night, but I fell asleep.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.500
Don't worry.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.550
You can give it to me later.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060
All right, guys.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.510
Let's make sandwiches with 
5,000 yen's worth of ingredients!

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.940
What? You used up all the money?

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.910
<i>Making sandwiches in a big group was a lot of fun.</i>

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.120
<i>Unlike 18 years ago, we finished them all in one day.</i>

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.080
<i>It's fun having friends.</i>

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.080
<i>Hinazuki and I got a lot of presents from everyone.</i>

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.540
<i>And...</i>

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.070
Open it.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.130
Thank you, Fujinuma.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.320
All of you, too. Thank you so much.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.250
We'll clean up.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.150
You walk Hinazuki home.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.160
It's c-c-cold.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.360
Are you stupid?

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.370
B-Bye.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.260
Here.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.070
I'm glad I became friends with you and the others.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.040
Thanks for today.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.700
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.460
That's a promise.{;___;}

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.730
Okay. It's a promise.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.840
Good night.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.580
Good night.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.660
<i>Yes!</i>

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.780
<i>I did it!</i>

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.860
<i>I made it through!</i>

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.030
<i>I changed history!</i>

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.380
<i>The guys were gone by the time I got home.</i>

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.500
<i>With my fatigue from the past
two days reaching its limit,</i>

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.680
<i>and my mind being freed from all the tension,</i>

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.430
<i>I instantly collapsed into bed and slept like a log.</i>

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.400
<i>Damn, I'm late!</i>

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.850
Good morning!

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.530
Oh, Satoru.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.980
Not late, then.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.950
<i>S-Safe...</i>

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.510
So Kayo's the only one who's late.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.500
<i>The day after our birthday,
Hinazuki didn't come to school.</i>

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.220
<i>The promise we made at the end...</i>

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.510
<i>was never fulfilled.</i>
