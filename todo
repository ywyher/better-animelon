update the skeletons for general settings and subtitle styles since you chagned the content

hooks for other settings too

hide spoilers

tooltip for naming dialog telling about the settings 

maybe segmented options instead of a switch

watch or info page
> Choose whether to go to the info page or watch page when selecting an anime.

maybe on the info page if its an anime of 1episodes just fetch it right away

auto add to list

screenshot button

maybe use-general-settings for cleaner code ??

so when we log as anon we should invalidate the session query a7a

dialog z-index > toast z-index => bad UX 
i suppose it can be fixed using createPortal from react

use cache for session which are being fetched from the server ??

input validation/sanitization 

check turoborepo

check if memoizing subtitle cue solve the performance issue on vivaldi

implement caching for the mapper

episodes metadata for the episode selector

for schedules dont use anilist its based on japanese tv

copy cue when it comes

preview subtitle for when the settings change (not important)

stop at each cue setting
