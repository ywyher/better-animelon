use-prefetch hook uses the old add style 

cuz styles hook set even if not exists so they doesnt use all 

somehow the styles doesnt apply to the transcriptions

when changing transcription order in the player it doesnt ask for sync player settings maybe you add that

so currently in the watch page the database values aint getting set to the store for the styles probably from use-subtitle-store

use cache for session which are being fetched from the server ??

rename syncPlayerSettings to syncStrategy ig ??

input validation/sanitization 

check turoborepo

check if memoizing subtitle cue solve the performance issue on vivaldi

add to list have a bug

what needs to be done now is that we should implement useMutation for enabled-transcriptions
afterwards we should check why the mapper is being called twice and check the cache and some stuff ig

implement caching for the mapper

active subtitle file doesnt change when episode change prob cause if the cache system ?

episodes metadata for the episode selector

for schedules dont use anilist its based on japanese tv

a bug with the delay controller

a bug with removing a transcription from the list

copy cue when it comes

preview subtitle for when the settings change

stop at each cue setting
